The surprising sig nificance of positive emotion may be potentially related to high-levels of emotion in general in discrimination, or pos itivity in response to self-narration of discrimination expe riences (Tynes et al. 2012). The ubiquity of emotion in dis crimination is also supported by the increased frequency of the empath feature sadness in discrimination Tweets (Table 5).

Some 42% of teens say they have been called offensive names online or via their cellphone.
2.One-quarter of teens say they have been sent explicit images they didn’t ask for, while 7% say someone has shared explicit images of them without their consent. 
3.The vast majority of teens (90% in this case) believe online harassment is a problem that affects people their age, and 63% say this is a major problem.Some 39% of girls say someone has spread false rumors about them online, compared with 26% of boys who say this.
4.In addition to these gender differences, teens from lower-income families are more likely than those from higher-income families to encounter certain forms of online bullying. For example, 24% of teens whose household income is less than $30,000 a year say they have been the target of physical threats online, compared with 12% whose annual household income is $75,000 or more. However, teens’ experiences with these issues do not statistically differ by race or ethnicity, or by their parent’s level of educational attainment.
5.The likelihood of teens facing abusive behavior also varies by how often teens go online. Some 45% of teens say they are online almost constantly, and these constant users are more likely to face online harassment. Fully 67% of teens who are online almost constantly have been cyberbullied, compared with 53% of those who use the internet several times a day or less. These differences also extend to specific kinds of behaviors. For example, half of teens who are near-constant internet users say they have been called offensive names online, compared with about a third (36%) who use the internet less frequently.",,

Those who appear to have higher rates of body dissatisfaction checked social media more often than their peers who did not report high rates of body dissatisfaction. Those more dissatisfied with their bodies due to social media were also more likely to have depressive symptoms, online social anxiety, difficulties making friends, and were overall more socially isolated. Those who followed celebirties on social media were more liekly to check social media more often and exhibit depressive symptoms and online social anxiety. ",,"Even though the study does not establish a directionality of cause and effect bewteen social media-related body dissatisfaction, social media use, depressive symptoms, and online social anxiety, it is safe to conclude that the strong relationship between the factors points to implications of social media use and content on one's social media in overall mental wellbeing and satisfaction with body image and physical appearence. It is important to note that even though social media was not proved to be the cause of body dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and social anxiety, it does seem to play a reinforcing role in the maintenence of dissatisfaction in appearence and negative socioemotinal effects in adolescents who already display such symptoms.
